                                          Measures of dispersion

-> Standard Deviation : Defined as the positive square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the deviations of the given 
   observations from their arithmetic mean. (Denoted by 𝜎)

                                |------------------|
                                | 𝜎 = √(∑X - A.M)^2 |
                                |     -----------  |
                                |         √n       |
                                |------------------|


-> Variance : Square of the standard deviation (Denoted by 𝜎^2)

                                |--------------------|
                                | Variance = (S.D)^2 |
                                |--------------------|

-> Imp points :

                                |---------------------|
                                | Var(X + a) = Var(X) |
                                |---------------------|


                                |------------------------|
                                | Var(aX) = a^2 * Var(X) |
                                |------------------------|


                                |----------------------------|
                                | Var(aX + b) = a^2 * Var(X) |
                                |----------------------------|

                                    where a and b are constants


-> Standard deviation through step deviation method : 

                                |----------------------|
                                | 𝜎 = √(∑fd^2 - A.M^2) |
                                |      ------          |
                                |       √∑f            |
                                |----------------------|


-> Combined Standard deviation : That means if sizes and S.D of 2 series are given then we can calculate the combined S.D also

                                |------------------------------------------|
                                | 𝜎 = √(n1(𝜎1^2 + d1^2) + n2(𝜎2^2 + d2^2)) |
                                |     ------------------------------------ |
                                |               √(n1 + n2)                 |
                                |------------------------------------------|
                                                                       __   _      __   _
                                      where d1 and d2 are respectively X1 - X  &   X2 - X 
                                            _     __     __
                                            X = n1X1 + n2X2
                                                -----------
                                                  n1 + n2


                                    (Similarly would be for k groups in general)


-> Consistency -:
              • Better performance
              • Dispersion(Variation) must be small
 
          So to have both of these characteristics for consistency , coefficient of variation is used 


-> Relative measure of dispersion based on the S.D is called Coefficient of standard deviation (independent of the units)

                                |-------------------|      
                                | Coef. of S.D = 𝜎  |
                                |               --- |
                                |               A.M |
                                |-------------------|



-> Coefficient of variation is 100 times the coef. of S.D
                                |-------------------------------|      
                                | Coef. of Variation = 𝜎        |
                                |                     --- * 100 |
                                |                     A.M       |
                                |-------------------------------|

-> • Less C.V is said to be more homogeneous and uniform or less variable than the other
   • More C.V is said to be more heterogeneous or more uniform than the other
