MEAN

For a continuous series
Direct method ->
              X = (L + U) / 2
                     _
              A.M is X = E(fX)/Ef

Step deviation _-> 
               X = A + f (E(fd)/Ef)
               where d = (x - A)/h  is the step deviation
               A is the assumed mean
               h is the width of the class interval
