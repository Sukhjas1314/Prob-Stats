MEAN

For a continuous series -:
(1) Direct method ->
                   X = (L + U) / 2
                          _
                   A.M is X = E(fX)/Ef

(2) Step deviation _-> 
                   X = A + h*(E(fd)/Ef)
                   where d = (x - A)/h  is the step deviation
                   A is the assumed mean
                   h is the width of the class interval
