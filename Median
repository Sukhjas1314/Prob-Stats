                                   MEDIAN

-> It is a positional number which divides the given series into 2 equal parts.
      eg. 1,4,5,7,8
          In this ques Median is the 3rd position
      

-> For discrete series (Ungrouped data) -:

        Median = ((n + 1) / 2)th term    (if n is odd)
        Median = ((n / 2)th + ((n / 2) + 1)th) / 2 term      (if n is even)

-> For continuous series (Grouped data) -:

        Median = l + (h / f) * ((N / 2) - C) 
                where l : lower limit of median class
                      h : width of the median class
                      f : frequency of the median class
                      N : total frequency
                      C : Cumulative frequency (just preceding the median class)
